# promise-lib
A simplified implementation of Promises, as an educational tool

## About this repo

This repo uses test-driven development (TDD) to guide our implementation of Promises. The test suite alone will be useful for anyone who wants to learn or refresh their understanding of how Promises work.

## Contents

This repo contains two implementations of Promises:
* no chaining
* chaining

### No chaining
This implementation is a stepping stone for understanding some basic concepts about Promises. In particular, it introduces the concepts of `resolve` and `reject`, but it will not handle *chaining*, which is a slightly more challenging feature to implement (but a very critical one!).

### Chaining
This implementation builds off of the previous to introduce chaining.
